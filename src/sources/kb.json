            "description": "is a type of vehicle suspension powered by an electric or engine-driven air pump or compressor. This compressor pumps the air into a flexible bellows, usually made from textile-reinforced rubber. Unlike hydropneumatic suspension, which offers many similar features, air suspension does not use pressurized liquid, but pressurized air. The air pressure inflates the bellows, and raises the chassis from the axle."

            "description": "The kinetic energy of an object is equal to the work, force (F) times displacement (s), needed to achieve its stated velocity. Having gained this energy during its acceleration, the mass maintains this kinetic energy unless its speed changes. The same amount of work is done by the object when decelerating from its current speed to a state of rest."

            "description": "In physics, potential energy is the energy held by an object because of its position relative to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge, or other factors.[1][2] The term potential energy was introduced by the 19th-century Scottish engineer and physicist William Rankine,[3][4][5] although it has links to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle's concept of potentiality."

            "description": "In vector calculus and physics, a vector field is an assignment of a vector to each point in a space, most commonly Euclidean space R n .[1] A vector field on a plane can be visualized as a collection of arrows with given magnitudes and directions, each attached to a point on the plane. Vector fields are often used to model, for example, the speed and direction of a moving fluid throughout three dimensional space, such as the wind, or the strength and direction of some force, such as the magnetic or gravitational force, as it changes from one point to another point."
